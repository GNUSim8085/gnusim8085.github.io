# How to contribute

### Code (patches)
You can submit patches for bug fixes or feature implementations. If you come up with patch for some new functionality then please log a 'enhancement' bug first. Check the existing list of [bugs](https://github.com/GNUSim8085/GNUSim8085/issues){:target="_blank"}

### Documentation
The application now includes very basic user documentation. It is written in markdown syntax and converted to HTML as part of the installation. You can read it directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/GNUSim8085/GNUSim8085/blob/master/doc/help/userguide.md){:target="_blank"} or by clicking on Help -> Contents menu. If you wish to contribute to the documentation feel free to submit pull requests.
Meanwhile we distribute some sample programs with our application to help users learn assembly programming. You can always contribute your own programs.

### Testing
As with most Free software applications ours is mainly tested by user community. Please test the application as much as possible and file any bugs you find. You can focus the testing on a specific platform (ex. Windows) or specific area of application (ex. memory instructions).
Following are some areas where more testing is needed:

* Printing support on Windows - Printing issue Windows has been fixed in version 1.4.1. Any feedback from Windows users will be great.

### Porting
Even though our application was originally written for Linux distributions it has been ported to Windows now. We are interested in porting the application to other operating systems such as Mac OS X but do not have sufficient resources for this. If you have necessary skills to achieve this feel free to send pull requests.
