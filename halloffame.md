# Hall of fame
As for any popular Free software project we have received substancial contributions (code and other things) from our users that have improved the application over time. This page is created to list and appriciate some of these contributions. The contributions are listed on a release basis.
Note: Data for very old releases is not available. :-(

### 1.3.7
[Debjit Biswas](http://launchpad.net/~debjitbis08) contributed a huge patch for adding the functionality of easy view and editing of memory contents. Based on his work we also added similar functionality for I/O contents. He also contributed a patch to make adding breakpoints to the program very simple.

### 1.3.6
[Kartik Mistry](https://github.com/kartikm), the Gujarati geek, contributed the first ever translation in Gujarati language. He did this within fourteen hours of our call for translations.

[Kamaleshwar Morjal](http://www.eficacy.com/eficacy-designs/) created a nice icon for us that actually looks like a microprocessor. This gave a new look for our application.

### 1.3.5
This is the first release with Windows version. Madhusudhan. C. S. participated in the FOSS.IN workout conducted by [Aanjhan](https://aanjhan.com/). He helped us with testing the Windows version so we could actually make it usable.
